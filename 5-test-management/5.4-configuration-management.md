# 5.4 Configuration Management

The purpose of configuration management is to establish and maintain the integrity of the component or system, the testware, and their relationships to one another through the project and product lifecycle. 

To properly support testing, configuration management may involve ensuring the following: 

* All test items are uniquely identified, version controlled, tracked for changes, and related to each other 
* All items of testware are uniquely identified, version controlled, tracked for changes, related to each other and related to versions of the test item\(s\) so that traceability can be maintained throughout the test process 
* All identified documents and software items are referenced unambiguously in test documentation 

During test planning, configuration management procedures and infrastructure \(tools\) should be identified and implemented.

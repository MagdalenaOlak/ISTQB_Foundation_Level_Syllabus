* Defect information \(e.g., defect density, defects found and fixed, failure rate, and confirmation test results\) 
* Test coverage of requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria, risks, or code 
* Task completion, resource allocation and usage, and effort 
* Cost of testing, including the cost compared to the benefit of finding the next defect or the cost compared to the benefit of running the next test

# 5.3 Test Monitoring and Control

The purpose of test monitoring is to gather information and provide feedback and visibility about test activities. Information to be monitored may be collected manually or automatically and should be used to assess test progress and to measure whether the test exit criteria, or the testing tasks associated with an Agile project's definition of done, are satisfied, such as meeting the targets for coverage of product risks, requirements, or acceptance criteria. 

Test control describes any guiding or corrective actions taken as a result of information and metrics gathered and \(possibly\) reported. Actions may cover any test activity and may affect any other software lifecycle activity. 

Examples of test control actions include: 

* Re-prioritizing tests when an identified risk occurs \(e.g., software delivered late\) 
* Changing the test schedule due to availability or unavailability of a test environment or other resources 
* Re-evaluating whether a test item meets an entry or exit criterion due to rework

# 5.1.2 Tasks of a Test Manager and Tester

In this syllabus, two test roles are covered, test managers and testers. The activities and tasks performed by these two roles depend on the project and product context, the skills of the people in the roles, and the organization. 

The test manager is tasked with overall responsibility for the test process and successful leadership of the test activities. The test management role might be performed by a professional test manager, or by a project manager, a development manager, or a quality assurance manager. In larger projects or organizations, several test teams may report to a test manager, test coach, or test coordinator, each team being headed by a test leader or lead tester. 

Typical test manager tasks may include: 

* Develop or review a test policy and test strategy for the organization
* Plan the test activities by considering the context, and understanding the test objectives and risks. This may include selecting test approaches, estimating test time, effort and cost, acquiring resources, defining test levels and test cycles, and planning defect management 
* Write and update the test plan\(s\) 
* Coordinate the test plan\(s\) with project managers, product owners, and others 
* Share testing perspectives with other project activities, such as integration planning 
* Initiate the analysis, design, implementation, and execution of tests, monitor test progress and results, and check the status of exit criteria \(or definition of done\) and facilitate test completion activities 
* Prepare and deliver test progress reports and test summary reports based on the information gathered 
* Adapt planning based on test results and progress \(sometimes documented in test progress reports, and/or in test summary reports for other testing already completed on the project\) and take any actions necessary for test control 
* Support setting up the defect management system and adequate configuration management of testware  Introduce suitable metrics for measuring test progress and evaluating the quality of the testing and the product 
* Support the selection and implementation of tools to support the test process, including recommending the budget for tool selection \(and possibly purchase and/or support\), allocating time and effort for pilot projects, and providing continuing support in the use of the tool\(s\) 
* Decide about the implementation of test environment\(s\) 
* Promote and advocate the testers, the test team, and the test profession within the organization 
* Develop the skills and careers of testers \(e.g., through training plans, performance evaluations, coaching, etc.\) 

The way in which the test manager role is carried out varies depending on the software development lifecycle. For example, in Agile development, some of the tasks mentioned above are handled by the Agile team, especially those tasks concerned with the day-to-day testing done within the team, often by a tester working within the team. Some of the tasks that span multiple teams or the entire organization, or that have to do with personnel management, may be done by test managers outside of the development team, who are sometimes called test coaches. See Black 2009 for more on managing the test process. 

Typical tester tasks may include: 

* Review and contribute to test plans  Analyze, review, and assess requirements, user stories and acceptance criteria, specifications, and models for testability \(i.e., the test basis\) 
* Identify and document test conditions, and capture traceability between test cases, test conditions, and the test basis 
* Design, set up, and verify test environment\(s\), often coordinating with system administration and network management 
* Design and implement test cases and test procedures  Prepare and acquire test data  Create the detailed test execution schedule
* Execute tests, evaluate the results, and document deviations from expected results  Use appropriate tools to facilitate the test process 
* Automate tests as needed \(may be supported by a developer or a test automation expert\)  Evaluate non-functional characteristics such as performance efficiency, reliability, usability, security, compatibility, and portability 
* Review tests developed by others 

People who work on test analysis, test design, specific test types, or test automation may be specialists in these roles. Depending on the risks related to the product and the project, and the software development lifecycle model selected, different people may take over the role of tester at different test levels. For example, at the component testing level and the component integration testing level, the role of a tester is often done by developers. At the acceptance test level, the role of a tester is often done by business analysts, subject matter experts, and users. At the system test level and the system integration test level, the role of a tester is often done by an independent test team. At the operational acceptance test level, the role of a tester is often done by operations and/or systems administration staff.

# 5.2.6 Test Estimation Techniques

There are a number of estimation techniques used to determine the effort required for adequate testing. Two of the most commonly used techniques are: 

* The metrics-based technique: estimating the test effort based on metrics of former similar projects, or based on typical values 
* The expert-based technique: estimating the test effort based on the experience of the owners of the testing tasks or by experts 

For example, in Agile development, burndown charts are examples of the metrics-based approach as effort remaining is being captured and reported, and is then used to feed into the teamâ€™s velocity to determine the amount of work the team can do in the next iteration; whereas planning poker is an example of the expert-based approach, as team members are estimating the effort to deliver a feature based on their experience \(ISTQB-CTFL-AT\). 

Within sequential projects, defect removal models are examples of the metrics-based approach, where volumes of defects and time to remove them are captured and reported, which then provides a basis for estimating future projects of a similar nature; whereas the Wideband Delphi estimation technique is an example of the expert-based approach in which a group of experts provides estimates based on their experience \(ISTQB-CTAL-TM\).

# 5.2.5 Factors Influencing the Test Effort

Test effort estimation involves predicting the amount of test-related work that will be needed in order to meet the objectives of the testing for a particular project, release, or iteration. Factors influencing the test effort may include characteristics of the product, characteristics of the development process, characteristics of the people, and the test results, as shown below. 

### Product characteristics 

* The risks associated with the product
* The quality of the test basis 
* The size of the product 
* The complexity of the product domain
* The requirements for quality characteristics \(e.g., security, reliability\) 
* The required level of detail for test documentation 
* Requirements for legal and regulatory compliance 

### Development process characteristics 

* The stability and maturity of the organization 
* The development model in use
* The test approach 
* The tools used
* The test process
* Time pressure 

### People characteristics 

* The skills and experience of the people involved, especially with similar projects and products \(e.g., domain knowledge\) 
* Team cohesion and leadership 

### Test results 

* The number and severity of defects found 
* The amount of rework required

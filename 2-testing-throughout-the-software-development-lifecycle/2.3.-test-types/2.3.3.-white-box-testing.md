# 2.3.3. White-box Testing

White-box testing derives tests based on the systemâ€™s internal structure or implementation. Internal structure may include code, architecture, work flows, and/or data flows within the system \(see section 4.3\). 

The thoroughness of white-box testing can be measured through structural coverage. Structural coverage is the extent to which some type of structural element has been exercised by tests, and is expressed as a percentage of the type of element being covered. 

At the component testing level, code coverage is based on the percentage of component code that has been tested, and may be measured in terms of different aspects of code \(coverage items\) such as the percentage of executable statements tested in the component, or the percentage of decision outcomes tested. These types of coverage are collectively called code coverage. At the component integration testing level, white-box testing may be based on the architecture of the system, such as interfaces between components, and structural coverage may be measured in terms of the percentage of interfaces exercised by tests. 

White-box test design and execution may involve special skills or knowledge, such as the way the code is built, how data is stored \(e.g., to evaluate possible database queries\), and how to use coverage tools and to correctly interpret their results.

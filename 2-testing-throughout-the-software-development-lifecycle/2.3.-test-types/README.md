# 2.3. Test Types

A test type is a group of test activities aimed at testing specific characteristics of a software system, or a part of a system, based on specific test objectives. Such objectives may include:

* Evaluating functional quality characteristics, such as completeness, correctness, and appropriateness
* Evaluating non-functional quality characteristics, such as reliability, performance efficiency, security, compatibility, and usability 
* Evaluating whether the structure or architecture of the component or system is correct, complete, and as specified 
* Evaluating the effects of changes, such as confirming that defects have been fixed \(confirmation testing\) and looking for unintended changes in behavior resulting from software or environment changes \(regression testing\)

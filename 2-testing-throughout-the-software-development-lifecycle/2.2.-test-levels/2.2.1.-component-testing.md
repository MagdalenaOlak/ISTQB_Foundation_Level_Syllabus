# 2.2.1. Component Testing

## Objectives of component testing 

Component testing \(also known as unit or module testing\) focuses on components that are separately testable. 

### Objectives of component testing include: 

* Reducing risk 
* Verifying whether the functional and non-functional behaviors of the component are as designed and specified 
* Building confidence in the componentâ€™s quality 
* Finding defects in the component 

Preventing defects from escaping to higher test levels In some cases, especially in incremental and iterative development models \(e.g., Agile\) where code changes are ongoing, automated component regression tests play a key role in building confidence that changes have not broken existing components. 

Component testing is often done in isolation from the rest of the system, depending on the software development lifecycle model and the system, which may require mock objects, service virtualization, harnesses, stubs, and drivers. Component testing may cover functionality \(e.g., correctness of calculations\), non-functional characteristics \(e.g., searching for memory leaks\), and structural properties \(e.g., decision testing\).

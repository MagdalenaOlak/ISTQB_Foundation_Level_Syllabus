# 2.2. Test Levels

Test levels are groups of test activities that are organized and managed together. Each test level is an instance of the test process, consisting of the activities described in section 1.4, performed in relation to software at a given level of development, from individual units or components to complete systems or, where applicable, systems of systems. Test levels are related to other activities within the software development lifecycle. 

## The test levels used in this syllabus are: 

* Component testing 
* Integration testing 
* System testing 
* Acceptance testing 

### Test levels are characterized by the following attributes:

* Specific objectives 
* Test basis, referenced to derive test cases 
* Test object \(i.e., what is being tested\) 
* Typical defects and failures 
* Specific approaches and responsibilities 

For every test level, a suitable test environment is required. In acceptance testing, for example, a production-like test environment is ideal, while in component testing the developers typically use their own development environment.

### Learning Objectives for Testing Throughout the Software Development Lifecycle 

#### 2.1 Software Development Lifecycle Models 

* FL-2.1.1 \(K2\) Explain the relationships between software development activities and test activities in the software development lifecycle 
* FL-2.1.2 \(K1\) Identify reasons why software development lifecycle models must be adapted to the context of project and product characteristics 

#### 2.2 Test Levels 

* FL-2.2.1 \(K2\) Compare the different test levels from the perspective of objectives, test basis, test objects, typical defects and failures, and approaches and responsibilities 

#### 2.3 Test Types 

* FL-2.3.1 \(K2\) Compare functional, non-functional, and white-box testing 
* FL-2.3.2 \(K1\) Recognize that functional, non-functional, and white-box tests occur at any test level 
* FL-2.3.3 \(K2\) Compare the purposes of confirmation testing and regression testing 

#### 2.4 Maintenance Testing 

* FL-2.4.1 \(K2\) Summarize triggers for maintenance testing 
* FL-2.4.2 \(K2\) Describe the role of impact analysis in maintenance testing

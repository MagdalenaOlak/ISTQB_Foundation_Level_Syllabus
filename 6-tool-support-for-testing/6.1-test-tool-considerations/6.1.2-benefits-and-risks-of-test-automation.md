# 6.1.2 Benefits and Risks of Test Automation

Simply acquiring a tool does not guarantee success. Each new tool introduced into an organization will require effort to achieve real and lasting benefits. There are potential benefits and opportunities with the use of tools in testing, but there are also risks. This is particularly true of test execution tools \(which is often referred to as test automation\).

Potential benefits of using tools to support test execution include: 

* Reduction in repetitive manual work \(e.g., running regression tests, environment set up/tear down tasks, re-entering the same test data, and checking against coding standards\), thus saving time 
* Greater consistency and repeatability \(e.g., test data is created in a coherent manner, tests are executed by a tool in the same order with the same frequency, and tests are consistently derived from requirements\) 
* More objective assessment \(e.g., static measures, coverage\) 
* Easier access to information about testing \(e.g., statistics and graphs about test progress, defect rates and performance\)

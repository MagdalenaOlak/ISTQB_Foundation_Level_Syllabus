# 6.1.3 Special Considerations for Test Execution and Test Management Tools

In order to have a smooth and successful implementation, there are a number of things that ought to be considered when selecting and integrating test execution and test management tools into an organization. 

#### Test execution tools 

Test execution tools execute test objects using automated test scripts. This type of tools often requires significant effort in order to achieve significant benefits.

* **Capturing test approach:** Capturing tests by recording the actions of a manual tester seems attractive, but this approach does not scale to large numbers of test scripts. A captured script is a linear representation with specific data and actions as part of each script. This type of script may be unstable when unexpected events occur, and require ongoing maintenance as the systemâ€™s user interface evolves over time. 
* **Data-driven test approach**: This test approach separates out the test inputs and expected results, usually into a spreadsheet, and uses a more generic test script that can read the input data and execute the same test script with different data. 
* **Keyword-driven test approach**: This test approach, a generic script processes keywords describing the actions to be taken \(also called action words\), which then calls keyword scripts to process the associated test data.

# 6.1 Test Tool Considerations

Test tools can be used to support one or more testing activities. Such tools include:

* Tools that are directly used in testing, such as test execution tools and test data preparation tools 
* Tools that help to manage requirements, test cases, test procedures, automated test scripts, test results, test data, and defects, and for reporting and monitoring test execution
* Tools that are used for analysis and evaluation 
* Any tool that assists in testing \(a spreadsheet is also a test tool in this meaning\)

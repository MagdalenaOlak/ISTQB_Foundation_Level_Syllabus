# 6.2.1 Main Principles for Tool Selection

The main considerations in selecting a tool for an organization include: 

* Assessment of the maturity of the own organization, its strengths and weaknesses 
* Identification of opportunities for an improved test process supported by tools 
* Understanding of the technologies used by the test object\(s\), in order to select a tool that is compatible with that technology 
* Understanding the build and continuous integration tools already in use within the organization, in order to ensure tool compatibility and integration 
* Evaluation of the tool against clear requirements and objective criteria 
* Consideration of whether or not the tool is available for a free trial period \(and for how long\)

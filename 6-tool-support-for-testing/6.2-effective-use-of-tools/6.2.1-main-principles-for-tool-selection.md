# 6.2.1 Main Principles for Tool Selection

The main considerations in selecting a tool for an organization include: 

* Assessment of the maturity of the own organization, its strengths and weaknesses 
* Identification of opportunities for an improved test process supported by tools 
* Understanding of the technologies used by the test object\(s\), in order to select a tool that is compatible with that technology 
* Understanding the build and continuous integration tools already in use within the organization, in order to ensure tool compatibility and integration 
* Evaluation of the tool against clear requirements and objective criteria 
* Consideration of whether or not the tool is available for a free trial period \(and for how long\)
* Evaluation of the vendor \(including training, support and commercial aspects\) or support for noncommercial \(e.g., open source\) tools 
* Identification of internal requirements for coaching and mentoring in the use of the tool 
* Evaluation of training needs, considering the testing \(and test automation\) skills of those who will be working directly with the tool\(s\) 
* Consideration of pros and cons of various licensing models \(e.g., commercial or open source\) 
* Estimation of a cost-benefit ratio based on a concrete business case \(if required\) 

As a final step, a proof-of-concept evaluation should be done to establish whether the tool performs effectively with the software under test and within the current infrastructure or, if necessary, to identify changes needed to that infrastructure to use the tool effectively.

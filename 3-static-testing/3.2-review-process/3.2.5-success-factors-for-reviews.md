# 3.2.5 Success Factors for Reviews

In order to have a successful review, the appropriate type of review and the techniques used must be considered. In addition, there are a number of other factors that will affect the outcome of the review. 

Organizational success factors for reviews include: 

* Each review has clear objectives, defined during review planning, and used as measurable exit criteria 
* Review types are applied which are suitable to achieve the objectives and are appropriate to the type and level of software work products and participants 
* Any review techniques used, such as checklist-based or role-based reviewing, are suitable for effective defect identification in the work product to be reviewed 
* Any checklists used address the main risks and are up to date 
* Large documents are written and reviewed in small chunks, so that quality control is exercised by providing authors early and frequent feedback on defects 
* Participants have adequate time to prepare 
* Reviews are scheduled with adequate notice 
* Management supports the review process \(e.g., by incorporating adequate time for review activities in project schedules\) 
* Reviews are integrated in the company's quality and/or test policies.

People-related success factors for reviews include: 

* The right people are involved to meet the review objectives, for example, people with different skill sets or perspectives, who may use the document as a work input 
* Testers are seen as valued reviewers who contribute to the review and learn about the work product, which enables them to prepare more effective tests, and to prepare those tests earlier 
* Participants dedicate adequate time and attention to detail 
* Reviews are conducted on small chunks, so that reviewers do not lose concentration during individual review and/or the review meeting \(when held\) 
* Defects found are acknowledged, appreciated, and handled objectively 
* The meeting is well-managed, so that participants consider it a valuable use of their time 
* The review is conducted in an atmosphere of trust; the outcome will not be used for the evaluation of the participants 
* Participants avoid body language and behaviors that might indicate boredom, exasperation, or hostility to other participants 
* Adequate training is provided, especially for more formal review types such as inspections 
* A culture of learning and process improvement is promoted

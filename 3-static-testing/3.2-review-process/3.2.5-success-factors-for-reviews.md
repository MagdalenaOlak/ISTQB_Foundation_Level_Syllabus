# 3.2.5 Success Factors for Reviews

In order to have a successful review, the appropriate type of review and the techniques used must be considered. In addition, there are a number of other factors that will affect the outcome of the review. 

Organizational success factors for reviews include: 

* Each review has clear objectives, defined during review planning, and used as measurable exit criteria 
* Review types are applied which are suitable to achieve the objectives and are appropriate to the type and level of software work products and participants 
* Any review techniques used, such as checklist-based or role-based reviewing, are suitable for effective defect identification in the work product to be reviewed 
* Any checklists used address the main risks and are up to date 
* Large documents are written and reviewed in small chunks, so that quality control is exercised by providing authors early and frequent feedback on defects 
* Participants have adequate time to prepare 
* Reviews are scheduled with adequate notice 
* Management supports the review process \(e.g., by incorporating adequate time for review activities in project schedules\) 
* Reviews are integrated in the company's quality and/or test policies.

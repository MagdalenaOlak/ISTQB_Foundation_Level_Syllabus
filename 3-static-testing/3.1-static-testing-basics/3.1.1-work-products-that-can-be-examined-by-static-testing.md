# 3.1.1 Work Products that Can Be Examined by Static Testing

Almost any work product can be examined using static testing \(reviews and/or static analysis\), for example: 

* Specifications, including business requirements, functional requirements, and security requirements 
* Epics, user stories, and acceptance criteria 
* Architecture and design specifications 
* Code 
* Testware, including test plans, test cases, test procedures, and automated test scripts 
* User guides 
* Web pages 
* Contracts, project plans, schedules, and budget planning 
* Configuration set up and infrastructure set up 
* Models, such as activity diagrams, which may be used for Model-Based testing \(see ISTQBCTFL- MBT and Kramer 2016\) 

Reviews can be applied to any work product that the participants know how to read and understand. Static analysis can be applied efficiently to any work product with a formal structure \(typically code or models\) for which an appropriate static analysis tool exists. Static analysis can even be applied with tools that evaluate work products written in natural language such as requirements \(e.g., checking for spelling, grammar, and readability\).

# 1.1.2. Testing and Debugging

Testing and debugging are different. Executing tests can show failures that are caused by defects in the software. Debugging is the development activity that finds, analyzes, and fixes such defects. Subsequent confirmation testing checks whether the fixes resolved the defects. In some cases, testers are responsible for the initial test and the final confirmation test, while developers do the debugging, associated component and component integration testing \(continues integration\). However, in Agile development and in some other software development lifecycles, testers may be involved in debugging and component testing. 

ISO standard \(ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-1\) has further information about software testing concepts.

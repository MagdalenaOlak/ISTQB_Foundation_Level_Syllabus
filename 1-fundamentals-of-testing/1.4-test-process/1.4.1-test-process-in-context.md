# 1.4.1 Test Process in Context

Contextual factors that influence the test process for an organization, include, but are not limited to: 

* Software development lifecycle model and project methodologies being used 
* Test levels and test types being considered 
* Product and project risks ï‚· Business domain
* Operational constraints, including but not limited to: 
  * Budgets and resources 
  * Timescales 
  * Complexity 
  * Contractual and regulatory requirements
* Organizational policies and practices 
* Required internal and external standards

The following sections describe general aspects of organizational test processes in terms of the following: 

* Test activities and tasks 
* Test work products 
* Traceability between the test basis and test work products 

It is very useful if the test basis \(for any level or type of testing that is being considered\) has measurable coverage criteria defined. The coverage criteria can act effectively as key performance indicators \(KPIs\) to drive the activities that demonstrate achievement of software test objectives \(see section 1.1.1\). 

For example, for a mobile application, the test basis may include a list of requirements and a list of supported mobile devices. Each requirement is an element of the test basis. Each supported device is also an element of the test basis. The coverage criteria may require at least one test case for each element of the test basis. Once executed, the results of these tests tell stakeholders whether specified requirements are fulfilled and whether failures were observed on supported devices. 

ISO standard \(ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-2\) has further information about test processes.

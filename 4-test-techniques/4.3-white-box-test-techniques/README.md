# 4.3 White-box Test Techniques

White-box testing is based on the internal structure of the test object. White-box test techniques can be used at all test levels, but the two code-related techniques discussed in this section are most commonly used at the component test level. There are more advanced techniques that are used in some safetycritical, mission-critical, or high integrity environments to achieve more thorough coverage, but those are not discussed here. For more information on such techniques, see the ISTQB-CTAL-TTA.

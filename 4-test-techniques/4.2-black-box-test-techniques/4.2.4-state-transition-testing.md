# 4.2.4 State Transition Testing

Decision tables are a good way to record complex business rules that a system must implement. When creating decision tables, the tester identifies conditions \(often inputs\) and the resulting actions \(often outputs\) of the system. These form the rows of the table, usually with the conditions at the top and the actions at the bottom. Each column corresponds to a decision rule that defines a unique combination of conditions which results in the execution of the actions associated with that rule. The values of the conditions and actions are usually shown as Boolean values \(true or false\) or discrete values \(e.g., red, green, blue\), but can also be numbers or ranges of numbers. These different types of conditions and actions might be found together in the same table.

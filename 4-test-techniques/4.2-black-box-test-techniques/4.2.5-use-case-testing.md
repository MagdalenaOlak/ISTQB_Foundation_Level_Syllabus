# 4.2.5 Use Case Testing

Tests can be derived from use cases, which are a specific way of designing interactions with software items. They incorporate requirements for the software functions. Use cases are associated with actors \(human users, external hardware, or other components or systems\) and subjects \(the component or system to which the use case is applied\).

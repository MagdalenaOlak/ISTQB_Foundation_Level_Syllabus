# 4.2.5 Use Case Testing

Tests can be derived from use cases, which are a specific way of designing interactions with software items. They incorporate requirements for the software functions. Use cases are associated with actors \(human users, external hardware, or other components or systems\) and subjects \(the component or system to which the use case is applied\).

Each use case specifies some behavior that a subject can perform in collaboration with one or more actors \(UML 2.5.1 2017\). A use case can be described by interactions and activities, as well as preconditions, postconditions and natural language where appropriate. Interactions between the actors and the subject may result in changes to the state of the subject. Interactions may be represented graphically by work flows, activity diagrams, or business process models.

A use case can include possible variations of its basic behavior, including exceptional behavior and error handling \(system response and recovery from programming, application and communication errors, e.g., resulting in an error message\). Tests are designed to exercise the defined behaviors \(basic, exceptional or alternative, and error handling\). Coverage can be measured by the number of use case behaviors tested divided by the total number of use case behaviors, normally expressed as a percentage.

For more information on coverage criteria for use case testing. \(see the ISTQB-CTAL-AT\).

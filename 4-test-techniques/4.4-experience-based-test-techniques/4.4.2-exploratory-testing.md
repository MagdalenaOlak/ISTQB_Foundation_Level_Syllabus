# 4.4.2 Exploratory Testing

In exploratory testing, informal \(not pre-defined\) tests are designed, executed, logged, and evaluated dynamically during test execution. The test results are used to learn more about the component or system, and to create tests for the areas that may need more testing. 

Exploratory testing is sometimes conducted using session-based testing to structure the activity. In session-based testing, exploratory testing is conducted within a defined time-box, and the tester uses a test charter containing test objectives to guide the testing. The tester may use test session sheets to document the steps followed and the discoveries made. 

Exploratory testing is most useful when there are few or inadequate specifications or significant time pressure on testing. Exploratory testing is also useful to complement other more formal testing techniques. 

Exploratory testing is strongly associated with reactive test strategies \(see section 5.2.2\). Exploratory testing can incorporate the use of other black-box, white-box, and experience-based techniques.
